# Roadmap

- Workspace isolation per agent (jj-based or filesystem snapshotting)
- DAG parallelism (multiple runnable stages at once)
- Artifact pushing (S3-compatible) and signed manifests
- Secret injection (sealed secrets + per-stage scopes)
- Pluggable executors (container runner, remote runner)
- Policy language for command allow/deny
